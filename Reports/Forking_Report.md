# VoltageSwap Custom Forking Report: Deployment Summary and Address Mapping

This report provides a summary of the steps taken to fork VoltageSwap, the responses received during the process, and the addresses of the deployed contracts.

## Deployment Process Summary

The deployment process was carried out on the Hardhat network and involved the use of the **Yarn** package manager to install dependencies and the Hardhat tool to compile and deploy the contracts.

1. The process was initiated with the `yarn` command, which completed successfully despite several warnings about unmet peer dependencies.

### Warnings Received

Here are the errors categorized into different tables based on their types:

Please note that some warnings/errors may fall under multiple categories, but this categorization provides a general overview of the different types of issues encountered.

1. The `NETWORK=hardhat yarn zx v3-deploy.mjs` command was then executed to deploy the contracts on the Hardhat network. This resulted in the successful compilation and deployment of several contracts, with warnings about contract code size exceeding 24576 bytes and missing SPDX license identifiers.
